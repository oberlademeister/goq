# goq A simple go json library to do stuff similar to jq

The standard golang json unmarshaler is quite nice and can be used with different types of data.
However, some data is not easy to unmarshal. More precisely, whenever a json slice is used that does have dissimilar object types in it.

This is where this library aims to be useful.
